In this example, stage-specific Argo CD Application resources point at a corresponding, stage-specific branch of a Git repository. Kargo watches the helm branch of that repository for new commits and also watches for new versions of the ghcr.io/dhpup/guestbook container image.

New versions of the commit + image pair are advanced from stage to stage by checking out the commit, updating a stage-specific Helm values file, then committing the entire working tree to the stage-specific branch.

Note that sourcing commits from one branch, but making commits to another branch prevents the formation of a loop.
