In this example, stage-specific Argo CD Application resources point directly at a specific version of the nginx chart in the Bitnami Helm chart repository and mix in a specific version of the public.ecr.aws/nginx/nginx container image. Kargo watches the chart repository for new versions of the nginx chart and watches for new versions of the public.ecr.aws/nginx/nginx image.

New chart + image pairs are advanced from stage to stage by updating the targetRevision field and Helm-specific parameters of each stage's corresponding Argo CD Application resource.
